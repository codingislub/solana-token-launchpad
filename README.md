# Solana Token Dashboard & Launchpad

This app lets you easily create and manage your own tokens on the Solana blockchain(DEVNET) — all from a simple web interface.

What it does:
Connect your Solana wallet right from the browser with popular wallet support.

Create your very own SPL token (think of it like your own custom cryptocurrency).

Mint tokens and send them to any Solana wallet address you want.

See confirmation messages and transaction details as you go, so you know everything worked.

The interface looks clean and modern thanks to Tailwind CSS.

How it works:
You just connect your wallet, create a token with a click, and then you can mint tokens to whoever you want by entering their wallet address and the amount. Behind the scenes, it uses Solana’s Web3.js and SPL Token libraries to interact with the blockchain, specifically the Devnet (Solana’s test network) so you can experiment without spending real money.
